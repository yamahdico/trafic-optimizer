Easily block All websites of your choice!
Block Site is a browser addon to help you block desired websites. To operate, simply right-click on any webpage and then click on the "Block this website" context-menu item. The website will be added to the block list. Please note, the whole domain will be added to the block list, not just a URL. To change this list, open the options page, and remove the desired item.

For any blocked domain, you can add a redirect URL in the options page. So instead of blocking a page, the website will be redirected to the desired URL. There is also an option to block desired iframes. To do so, please add the URL (for the iframe) in the designated area on the options page.

Note: to report bugs, please visit addon homepage and fill the bug report form.
